{EPITECH} | Second year | Functionnal Programming

The goal of this project is to implement Wolfram’s elementary cellular automaton in the terminal.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton]

You only have to implement rule 30, rule 90 and rule 110. The other rules are considered a bonus.

The space your cellular automaton are living in is infinite (to the left, right, and bottom).
This means the parts not shown on screen can still have an effect on future generations.
You have to handle the handling of the arguments yourself. Getopt is forbidden.

See the subject for further details !
